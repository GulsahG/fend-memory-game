## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## The Game

This game has two sets of 8 cards and the purpose of it is to match them all at the end of the game. The game shuffles all the cards at the start of the every game. Clicking two cards counts as 1 move and depending on the number of moves, you get a star rating. If you make more than 25 moves you get 1 star. If you make moves less than 25 but more than 20, you get 2 stars. Finally, if you make less than 20 moves, you get 3 stars. These stars are getting updated as you go through the game. And also you get to see the timer during the game. When you successfully finish the game, a modal appears and you see your star rating and the elapsed time. Also the game asks if you want to play the game again.
